=================
Lets make an app that Xamarin can look at and I can use.

I am working at Citigroup and we do Silverlight(XAML) so lets use forms.
We also use Infragistics I will use the Xamarin Forms beta controls

Would like to show interfaces, inheritance, overloads overrides and who knows maybe a little Dependcy Injection(but not overuse ;-)
